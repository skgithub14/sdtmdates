The goal of {sdtmdates} is to provide a set of tools for statistical programmers to transform raw electronic data cut (EDC) dates into ISO 8601 formatted dates for Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) data sets. The tools include utility functions for reshaping, trimming, and imputing date values.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {sdtmdates} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skgithub14/sdtmdates")
```

## Example

In this example, we start with a data frame with two columns, one with full dates and one with partial dates. The goal is to consolidate these dates into one ISO 8601 formatted date column. 

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
library(sdtmdates)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

raw_dates <- data.frame(
  raw_full = c(
    rep(NA, 8),
    "02/05/2017",
    "02-05-2017"
  ),
  raw_partial = c(
    "UN-UNK-UNKN", 
    "UN/UNK/UNKN",
    "UN UNK UNKN",
    "UN-UNK-2017",
    "UN-Feb-2017",
    "05-FEB-2017",
    "05-UNK-2017",
    "05-Feb-UNKN",
    rep(NA, 2)
  )
)
kable(raw_dates)
```

First, we will re-arrange the partial dates into the same format as the full dates using `reshape_pdates()`. That will let us combine the full and partial dates into one column with a MM/DD/YYYY format. Then, using `reshape_adates()`, we will convert all dates to the YYYY-MM-DD format.

```{r example2}
working_dates <- raw_dates %>%
  mutate(
    partial = reshape_pdates(raw_partial),
    all = coalesce(raw_full, partial),
    all = reshape_adates(all)
  )
kable(working_dates)
```


For situations where missing date elements should be removed, use the `trim_dates()` function.

```{r example3}
trimmed_dates <-  mutate(working_dates, trimmed = trim_dates(all))
kable(trimmed_dates)
```


If imputed dates are needed, use the `impute_pdates()` function. Both start and end dates can be imputed using standard imputation rules.

```{r example4}
imputed_dates <- working_dates %>%
  mutate(
    start = impute_pdates(all, ptype = "start"),
    end = impute_pdates(all, ptype = "end")
  )
kable(imputed_dates)
```
