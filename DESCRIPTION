Description: Statistical programmers are required to transform data snapshots 
    from an electronic data cut (EDC) into Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
    Consortium (CDSIC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) compliant data sets 
    per the guidelines in the SDTM Implementation Guide (SDTMIG). {sdtmdates} 
    provides utility functions for statistical programmers to convert full and 
    partial dates into SDTMIG compliant dates.
